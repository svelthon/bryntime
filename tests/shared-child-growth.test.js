// A child shared by many containers, a list every row holds or a class every
// instance reads an attribute off, costs what it links: eight times the
// containers take about eight times as long. Each new link searched the whole
// list of the child's parents and swept it, and eight times the containers took
// sixty-four times as long.
//
// Measured so that the suite's load does not decide it: the heap is collected
// before each run, no run keeps the rows of another, and the ratio is read at
// eight times the size, where linear and quadratic are 8 and 64 and the bound,
// 24, sits a factor three from both.
