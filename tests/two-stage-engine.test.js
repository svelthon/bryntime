// The parsing chain is a contiguous run of Brython's own scripts, and each one

// page loads the engine without it, and a route that compiles loads it after,
// onto the engine already there.
//
// That is what makes the size work decidable at build time rather than by a
// flag: a site ships `brython_runtime.js`, and only what compiles pays for
// `brython_compiler.js`.
//
// This file loads Bryve's two halves directly rather than through
// `bryntime.js`, which boots the engine.

// `globalThis.__BRYTHON__` and called `py2js` on it, which only existed because
// the first had loaded the chain: narrowing to it on a green tree gave
// `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'py2js')`, a failure that is
// not in the code. Narrowing a suite to one test is the first thing anyone does
// with a failure, so a file must not manufacture one.
