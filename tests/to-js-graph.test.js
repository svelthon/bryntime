// `pyData` was taught that a graph is not a tree, so a shared reference crosses
// into Python as one dict. `plainData` flattened it again on the way back: the
// round trip was not one, and `to_js` *is* `plainData` — the emitted code puts
// it on the return value of every Python function crossing to JavaScript.
//
// The flattening rule was not an oversight. It is right for the consumer that
// prompted it: `tojson` produces JSON, which has neither identity nor cycles.
// It was written for one of six callers and applied to all of them.
