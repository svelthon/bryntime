"""Rebuild the vendored Brython bundles from Brython master.

One pass, two files, so they can never drift apart again: the runtime bundle was
built once on 2026-08-30 and was eleven days and two dev versions behind the full
one by the time anybody looked.

Not `make_dist.py`, which also regenerates `stdlib_paths.js`, `version_info.js`
and the VFS with whatever the local tree happens to hold. This does lines 33 to
61 of it and nothing else: concatenate `core_scripts`, minify each, write out.
Nothing in the Brython checkout is touched.

The runtime bundle is the full one with the parsing chain cut out, and the cut is
made **by the markers**, not by a module list of our own: `compiler_scripts` and
the two marker strings are read from Brython's own build scripts, so this runs
the same contract a stranger would run against a published `brython.js`.
