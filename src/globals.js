// Brython was written as a classic browser script, and runs here as an ES
// module. Two things differ in that context and both must be settled *before*
// brython.js runs, hence a separate module, since ES imports are hoisted above
// statements.
//
//  - `document.currentScript` is null in a module, and brython.js dereferences
//    it to derive its own install path. Setting brython_path skips that branch
//    (brython.js, where it reads `document.currentScript`).
//  - the codegen builds its AST classes with eval(), whose code resolves `$B`
//    in *global* scope; a module-scoped binding would be invisible to it.
// Server-side rendering runs this same module under Node, where the bootstrap
// finds neither of these. brython.js shims `document` itself when it is absent,
// but not these two.

// Under Node, brython.js installs its own `document`, `location`, `HTMLElement`,
// `MutationObserver` and `customElements`, stubs its bootstrap needs, with three
// keys between them. They are also a trap: half the ecosystem decides it is in a
// browser with `typeof document !== "undefined"`, then reaches for `window`,
// which nothing defines. Bits UI does exactly that and takes server rendering
// down with a bare `ReferenceError: window is not defined`.
//
// So the names present before Brython loads are recorded here, and boot.js
// removes whatever it added, but only off a real browser, where these globals
// belong to the page and are none of our business.

// alone: `isNode = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.release.name ===
// 'node'` (brython.js, at `isNode`). The browser half is what builds `browser.html`,
// the module `$B.get_class` reads to give a DOM node its Python class; the Node
// half never defines it, and `node.value` from Python then dies inside
// `get_dict` on an undefined module.
//
// jsdom is the case where the question and its test disagree: it provides a DOM
// *and* a Node process. What brython.js means to ask is whether a DOM exists, so
// that is the question answered here, by shadowing the process object for the
// length of the load with one that inherits everything except the name being
// tested. boot.js puts the real one back.
