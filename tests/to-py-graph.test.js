// to a graph rather than to a tree. The walk had no memory: an array containing
// itself answered `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, and two
// references to one array became two lists.
//
// So each array is registered before its children are walked. That also settles
// the shared reference, which is the same fact seen without a cycle.
