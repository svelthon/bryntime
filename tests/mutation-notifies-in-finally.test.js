// *A mutation that raises has still mutated*, held as a property of the code
// rather than as a habit.
//
// The rule is one sentence: an interception that notifies a watched object must
// notify it whether the operation returned or raised, which in JavaScript means
// from a `finally` or from a `catch` that rethrows. It was learned four times,
// each time at a site someone had written by copying the site next to it:
// `extend` consuming a generator that then raised, `|=` interrupted halfway,
// `__setattr__` writing before failing, and `__delattr__` an hour after the
// setter beside it was repaired.
//
// The interceptions are a closed set living in one function, which is why this
// can be read off the code the way `tests/brython-contract.test.js` reads
// `BRYTHON.md`: the wrappers are found by their shape, so a ninth entry point
// joins the check by existing, and cannot ship with the notification on the
// success path alone.
//
// Two of them were outside the rule when this was written — `$setitem` and
// `$delitem`, the subscript pair, which notified after the call returned. No
// bench distinguishes them today: everything an author can write inside a
// `__setitem__` of their own goes through another interception, and that one
// notifies. The shape is made uniform all the same, because what these defects
// have in common is not a failure of reasoning but a copy of the neighbouring
// site.
